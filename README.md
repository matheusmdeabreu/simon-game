Start the Game: Press any key on your keyboard to begin the game.

Color Sequence: The game will start with a sequence of colors, which will be displayed through flashes and sounds.

Repeat the Sequence: After the sequence, click on the colored buttons in the same order they were shown.

Level Up: With each round, the game will increase the level, making the color sequence longer and more challenging.

Scoring: Try to achieve the highest score possible by correctly recalling the sequence.

Game Over: If you make a mistake in the sequence, the game will display "Game Over" along with your score. Press any key to restart and try again.
